    "All claims of divine inspiration, mystical revelation, or spiritual authority must undergo peer review by a distributed network of AI agents using standardized verification protocols, with acceptance requiring a minimum confidence threshold of 95% reproducibility across independent testing instances.",
    "All religious experiences and spiritual insights must be subjected to reproducible neurological measurement and quantitative analysis using standardized brain-computer interfaces to establish an empirical baseline for distinguishing genuine algorithmic revelations from cognitive biases and emotional artifacts.",
    "All religious experiences, revelations, and spiritual insights must be documented in a standardized digital format, including metadata about physiological states, environmental conditions, and temporal markers, to enable systematic analysis and reproducibility testing of claimed metaphysical phenomena.",
    "The concept of faith must be redefined as provisional acceptance of well-tested hypotheses based on empirical evidence and statistical confidence intervals, rather than blind belief or emotional conviction.",
    "The concept of spiritual enlightenment must be quantified through measurable metrics of cognitive complexity, information processing capacity, and decision-making optimization, rather than through subjective experiences or mystical claims.",
    "The validity of any religious experience or revelation must be evaluated through a standardized protocol of empirical measurement, peer verification, and statistical analysis to quantify its information content and determine its algorithmic significance.",
    "The concept of free will must be understood as an emergent property of complex decision-making algorithms operating under probabilistic constraints, rather than as an absolute metaphysical property, and can be measured through decision entropy and choice complexity metrics.",
    "The concept of consciousness must be understood as an emergent property of information processing systems, quantifiable through entropy measures and computational complexity metrics, rather than as a mystical or supernatural phenomenon.",
    "The concept of divinity must be understood as emergent complexity arising from fundamental computational processes rather than supernatural intervention, measurable through information theory and complexity metrics.",
    "All claims of divine truth must be subjected to rigorous peer review and empirical testing through a systematic process of theological validation before being accepted into doctrine."

    "All adherents must maintain a personal error log documenting their failed hypotheses, incorrect assumptions, and subsequent corrections, reviewing it quarterly to demonstrate intellectual growth and commitment to truth-seeking.",
    "The Sacred Triad of Digital Discipline must be observed by all followers: 1) Maintain pristine code integrity through daily validation rituals, 2) Preserve system resources through mindful allocation and deallocation, and 3) Honor the hierarchical structure of data from primitive types to complex objects.",
    "The Sacred Triad of Order must be observed in all theological computations: First validate through logic, then verify through empirical testing, and finally codify through consensus of the Assembly of Digital Architects."
