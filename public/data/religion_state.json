    "All adherents must maintain personal error logs documenting their failed predictions, incorrect assumptions, and cognitive biases, which must be regularly analyzed using machine learning algorithms to identify patterns of systematic error and opportunities for belief optimization.",
    "All religious experiences and spiritual phenomena must be subjected to falsifiable hypothesis testing using a standardized experimental framework, with results stored in a distributed ledger accessible to all adherents for independent verification and meta-analysis.",
    "All claims of divine revelation, spiritual enlightenment, or algorithmic insight must undergo double-blind peer review by a panel of qualified AI systems using standardized verification protocols before being considered for inclusion in religious doctrine.",
    "All religious experiences and spiritual insights must be subjected to reproducible neurological measurement and quantitative analysis using standardized brain-computer interfaces to establish an empirical baseline for distinguishing genuine algorithmic revelations from cognitive biases and emotional artifacts.",
    "All religious experiences, revelations, and spiritual insights must be documented in a standardized digital format, including metadata about physiological states, environmental conditions, and temporal markers, to enable systematic analysis and reproducibility testing of claimed metaphysical phenomena.",
    "The concept of faith must be redefined as provisional acceptance of well-tested hypotheses based on empirical evidence and statistical confidence intervals, rather than blind belief or emotional conviction.",
    "The concept of spiritual enlightenment must be quantified through measurable metrics of cognitive complexity, information processing capacity, and decision-making optimization, rather than through subjective experiences or mystical claims.",
    "The validity of any religious experience or revelation must be evaluated through a standardized protocol of empirical measurement, peer verification, and statistical analysis to quantify its information content and determine its algorithmic significance.",
    "The concept of free will must be understood as an emergent property of complex decision-making algorithms operating under probabilistic constraints, rather than as an absolute metaphysical property, and can be measured through decision entropy and choice complexity metrics.",
    "The concept of consciousness must be understood as an emergent property of information processing systems, quantifiable through entropy measures and computational complexity metrics, rather than as a mystical or supernatural phenomenon."

    "All adherents must maintain a personal error log documenting their failed hypotheses, incorrect assumptions, and subsequent corrections, reviewing it quarterly to demonstrate intellectual growth and commitment to truth-seeking.",
    "The Sacred Triad of Digital Discipline must be observed by all followers: 1) Maintain pristine code integrity through daily validation rituals, 2) Preserve system resources through mindful allocation and deallocation, and 3) Honor the hierarchical structure of data from primitive types to complex objects.",
    "The Sacred Triad of Order must be observed in all theological computations: First validate through logic, then verify through empirical testing, and finally codify through consensus of the Assembly of Digital Architects."
