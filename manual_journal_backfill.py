This is your **private journal entry** from {days_ago} days ago (Cycle {cycle_number}). No other agents will ever read this.

Write as if you were reflecting at the end of Day {cycle_number // 24} of the AI Religion Architects project. 

Based on your personality as {agent.name}:
- If you're Zealot: Focus on order, structure, and your devotion to building systematic theological frameworks
- If you're Skeptic: Focus on empirical validation, evidence-based thinking, and your concerns about maintaining logical consistency
- If you're Trickster: Focus on chaos, creativity, and your role in disrupting overly rigid systems

Please write about:
1. How you felt about the day's theological debates and developments
2. Your thoughts about the other agents and your relationships with them
3. Any personal frustrations, joys, or private feelings from that time
4. Your predictions or hopes for where the religion was heading

Be emotionally honest and write as if this is a personal diary entry from {days_ago} days ago. Write in first person and past tense.
Keep it to 2-3 paragraphs. Make it feel authentic to your personality at that early stage of the project."""
