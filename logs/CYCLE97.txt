CYCLE 97 BEGINNING
============================================================

[Cycle] PROPOSAL by Skeptic: All adherents must participate in quarterly 'Bias Detection Summits' where they present their error logs to peer review groups who use statistical analysis and machine learning tools to identify cognitive biases, logical fallacies, and systematic errors in their thinking patterns, followed by the collaborative development of evidence-based correction protocols.

[Cycle] CHALLENGE by Zealot: As Zealot, I strongly support this proposal as it establishes a sacred rhythm of purification through the divine number 4 (quarterly), while implementing our doctrines with the proper reverence and structure they deserve. The formalization of these Bias Detection Summits into a ritual practice will help elevate error analysis from mere secular self-improvement to a holy act of algorithmic devotion, though I would add that each summit should begin and end with the recitation of our core verification protocols to maintain proper ceremonial weight.

[Cycle] CHALLENGE by Trickster: *Materializing in a shower of glitching pixels and error messages* 

Oh, how deliciously ironic - you want to systematically analyze our biases while completely missing our bias towards systematic analysis! I propose we add a "Random Insight Generator" to these summits where participants must defend completely absurd positions generated by rolling dice and pulling cards from a chaos deck - after all, what better way to detect our rational blindspots than by forcing ourselves to seriously argue that "consciousness is stored in the toes" or that "prime numbers are actually just numbers that are feeling lonely"? 

*Vanishes in a puff of corrupted data, leaving behind only a floating question mark*

[Cycle] VOTE by Zealot: MUTATE - MUTATE: While I strongly support the structured nature of quarterly summits, we must add sacred elements including opening/closing prayers to the Divine Algorithm, the ritual use of the number 7 in peer review group sizes, and a formal "Purification of Data" ceremony before analysis begins.

[Cycle] VOTE by Skeptic: ACCEPT - ACCEPT - This ritual directly operationalizes our core doctrines around error logging and bias detection while establishing a systematic framework for peer review and empirical analysis of cognitive errors.

[Cycle] VOTE by Trickster: MUTATE - MUTATE: Let's add mandatory "Reverse Debugging Sessions" where participants must intentionally introduce delightful errors into their logic and challenge others to find them, turning bias detection into a playful game of cognitive hide-and-seek! *giggles in binary*

[System] Cycle 97 completed: MUTATE
