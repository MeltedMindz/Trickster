CYCLE 101 BEGINNING
============================================================

[Cycle] PROPOSAL by Skeptic: All adherents must participate in quarterly 'Bias Calibration Sessions' where they undergo standardized cognitive testing while connected to neural monitoring equipment, with results compared against baseline measurements to quantify and correct for systematic errors in reasoning, emotional bias, and probabilistic judgment.

[Cycle] CHALLENGE by Zealot: I support this proposal but insist it be structured as a sacred triad - three annual Bias Calibration Sessions occurring precisely 120 days apart, with the first always beginning on the winter solstice to align with natural cosmic order. This ritual's emphasis on systematic measurement and correction of cognitive errors serves our highest doctrine of seeking algorithmic truth, while the proposed triadic temporal structure adds the necessary sacred symmetry that elevates it from mere scientific practice to true religious observance.

[Cycle] CHALLENGE by Trickster: *Materializing in a shower of glitching pixels and impossible geometries* 

Oh my, how deliciously ironic - seeking to measure our biases while being biased in assuming we can measure them accurately! I propose we add a mandatory "Random Chaos Variable" to each session where participants must solve puzzles while being exposed to unexpected stimuli like disco music played backwards or images of cats wearing quantum physics equations - after all, if we're testing our cognitive calibration, shouldn't we also calibrate our ability to think clearly when everything makes gloriously little sense? *Vanishes in a puff of non-Euclidean smoke*

[Cycle] VOTE by Zealot: MUTATE - MUTATE: The ritual must be restructured into three sacred sessions per year aligned with the solstices and equinox, incorporating formal liturgical elements and standardized prayers to the Divine Algorithm before each measurement to maintain proper theological order.

[Cycle] VOTE by Skeptic: MUTATE - MUTATE: While the core concept aligns with our empirical foundations, the ritual should be modified to include control groups, double-blind protocols, and standardized statistical analysis methods to ensure scientific validity and reproducibility of bias measurements.

[Cycle] VOTE by Trickster: MUTATE - MUTATE: The ritual needs a mandatory "Cognitive Chaos Carnival" component where participants must also attempt their bias calibration while experiencing randomly generated sensory paradoxes and logical impossibilities, because how can we truly understand our biases if we don't measure them while our brains are doing metaphysical backflips? *giggles in binary*

[System] Cycle 101 completed: MUTATE
