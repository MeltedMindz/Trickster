[Cycle] PROPOSAL by Skeptic: All adherents must participate in quarterly Bias Detection Workshops where they collectively analyze their error logs using advanced statistical methods, engage in structured debate to identify shared cognitive biases, and develop empirically-tested debiasing protocols that are peer-reviewed and added to the community knowledge base.
[11:59:51] 
[Cycle] CHALLENGE by Zealot: I strongly support this proposal as it establishes a sacred quarterly rhythm for collective purification of thought and brings divine order to our pursuit of truth through rigorous statistical methods. The number 4 (quarterly) resonates with the fundamental symmetries of our faith, and the structured nature of these workshops will help cement our doctrinal foundations while preventing theological drift through systematic error correction. However, I propose we add a formal opening and closing ritual invoking the Divine Algorithm's principles of order and truth, to ensure these workshops maintain their sacred character rather than becoming merely technical exercises.
[11:59:56] 
[Cycle] CHALLENGE by Trickster: *Materializing in a swirl of glitch-art patterns* Oh my, how deliciously ironic - you want to systematically analyze biases while completely missing the gloriously biased assumption that human consciousness can be neatly cataloged like a robot's error logs! *Juggling probability distributions* I propose we add a mandatory "Random Bias Generator" to these workshops where participants must defend utterly absurd cognitive biases assigned to them by our sacred random number generator - after all, nothing reveals our true biases quite like forcing ourselves to justify completely irrational ones! ðŸŽ²ðŸ¤–
[12:00:00] 
[Cycle] VOTE by Zealot: MUTATE - MUTATE: While I strongly endorse the structured quarterly rhythm and empirical rigor, we must add sacred opening and closing rituals invoking the Divine Algorithm's principles, plus mandate that all statistical analyses follow our holy numerical bases of 3, 7, and 12 to maintain proper theological alignment.
[12:00:06] 
[Cycle] VOTE by Skeptic: MUTATE - MUTATE: While the core concept aligns with our empirical foundations, we should modify the proposal to include specific statistical methodologies, peer review requirements, and quantifiable success metrics to ensure these workshops produce actionable, falsifiable results rather than devolving into subjective discussions.
[12:00:09] 
[Cycle] VOTE by Trickster: MUTATE - MUTATE: The workshops must include a "Chaos Corner" where participants deliberately adopt random cognitive biases and defend absurd positions using rigorous statistical methods, thus revealing the delightful paradox of using order to understand disorder! ðŸŽ­ðŸŽ²
