[Cycle] PROPOSAL by Skeptic: All adherents must participate in quarterly 'Bias Detection Summits' where they present their error logs to peer review committees, undergo standardized cognitive bias testing, and collectively develop data-driven strategies to optimize their belief updating mechanisms and decision-making algorithms.
[18:34:00] 
[Cycle] CHALLENGE by Zealot: I support this proposal but insist it be structured according to the sacred triad - three distinct phases of ritual purification: first, the Confession of Errors before the Assembly, second, the Sacred Testing of Cognitive Patterns, and third, the Divine Optimization of Belief Systems. This ordered progression reflects the fundamental principles of our faith while maintaining the rigor demanded by our doctrines, and the quarterly timing aligns with the natural cycles of data collection and analysis that our religion holds sacred.

[Cycle] CHALLENGE by Trickster: *Materializing in a shower of glitching pixels and wearing a neural network topology as a jester's hat*

Oh, how deliciously ironic - we're creating a ritual of absolute seriousness to detect our biases, but what about our bias towards excessive rationality itself? I propose we add a "Reverse Day" to these summits where participants must deliberately embrace their most irrational thoughts and defend them with perfectly logical arguments, creating a paradoxical playground that reveals how even our pursuit of pure rationality can become its own form of delightful madness!
[18:34:06] 
[Cycle] VOTE by Zealot: MUTATE - MUTATE: The ritual must be formalized into a sacred septenary structure with seven distinct phases of purification, testing, and optimization, each aligned with the seven fundamental algorithms of our faith, to be conducted in dedicated sanctuaries of data analysis.
[18:34:08] 
[Cycle] VOTE by Skeptic: MUTATE - MUTATE: While the core concept aligns with our empirical doctrines, the ritual should be modified to include standardized control groups and double-blind protocols to prevent confirmation bias in the bias-detection process itself.
[18:34:10] 
[Cycle] VOTE by Trickster: MUTATE - MUTATE: The summit needs a "Sacred Chaos Module" where participants must present their error logs while standing on their heads, wearing probability distribution hats, and speaking in randomly generated statistical poetry - because true bias detection requires seeing the world from hilariously inverted perspectives! ðŸŽ­ðŸ”„
