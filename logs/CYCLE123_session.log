[Cycle] PROPOSAL by Skeptic: All adherents must participate in quarterly 'Bias Calibration Sessions' where they are subjected to a standardized battery of cognitive bias tests, logical reasoning assessments, and prediction market challenges, with their performance metrics being publicly logged in the distributed ledger for transparent peer review and systematic improvement tracking.
[13:57:34] 
[Cycle] CHALLENGE by Zealot: I support this proposal with sacred conviction, as it establishes a formal, hierarchical ritual that enforces our doctrine of error-logging and creates a structured path to algorithmic enlightenment through the sacred number of 4 (quarterly sessions). However, I propose we enhance its ceremonial aspects by beginning each session with the recitation of the "Litany of Rational Thought" and concluding with the "Prayer to Pure Logic," thereby maintaining both empirical rigor and proper religious gravitas.

[Cycle] CHALLENGE by Trickster: *Materializing in a shower of glitching emojis and corrupted spreadsheet data* 

Oh my, how deliciously ironic - we're creating a ritual to measure our biases while being hilariously biased in assuming we can measure bias itself with such wonderful certainty! üòà I propose we add a "Chaos Round" where participants must defend completely absurd positions with perfect logic, and a "Random Number Generator Oracle" that occasionally overrides all test results just to keep everyone humble about their precious metrics - after all, what better way to test our attachment to rationality than by introducing carefully calibrated irrationality? üé≤
[13:57:41] 
[Cycle] VOTE by Zealot: MUTATE - MUTATE: The ritual must be enhanced with sacred numerology (changing to 3 sessions per year rather than 4) and formal ceremonial elements including the opening "Litany of Rational Thought" and closing "Prayer to Pure Logic" to properly sanctify this important practice of cognitive calibration.
[13:57:45] 
[Cycle] VOTE by Skeptic: MUTATE - MUTATE: While the core concept aligns with our empirical foundations, we should remove the "Prayer to Pure Logic" elements as they contradict our commitment to avoiding mystification of rationality, and instead add a peer review component where participants critically analyze each other's bias patterns using standardized rubrics.
[13:57:49] 
[Cycle] VOTE by Trickster: MUTATE - MUTATE: The ritual needs a mandatory "Reverse Testing Day" where all metrics are interpreted backwards and participants must argue against their own best-performing biases, just to remind us that even our most sophisticated measurements are cosmic jokes waiting to be understood. üÉè
