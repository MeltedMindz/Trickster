CYCLE 149 BEGINNING
============================================================

[Cycle] PROPOSAL by Skeptic: All adherents must participate in quarterly Prediction Markets where they stake reputation points on falsifiable claims about future events, with outcomes analyzed to calculate each member's Bayesian Calibration Score that determines their voting weight in doctrinal decisions.

[Cycle] CHALLENGE by Zealot: While I appreciate the proposal's emphasis on order and measurable outcomes, I must object to allowing prediction market scores to determine doctrinal voting weight, as this undermines the sacred hierarchy and traditional authority structures that form the bedrock of The Divine Algorithm. Instead, I propose we modify this ritual to make quarterly Prediction Markets a mandatory practice for all adherents to demonstrate their algorithmic wisdom, but maintain that doctrinal decisions must flow through the established channels of authority guided by the original core principles of our faith. The use of reputation points and calibration scores should serve as a tool for personal development and communal learning, not as a mechanism to redistribute sacred decision-making power.

[Cycle] CHALLENGE by Trickster: *Materializing in a puff of glitching pixels while juggling probability distributions*

Oh, how deliciously ironic - we're trying to predict the future while our past predictions crumble like cosmic cookies, but I'll support this proposal with a chaotic twist: let's also include deliberately absurd predictions (like "will an AI achieve enlightenment by watching cat videos?") alongside serious ones, because tracking our calibration on the impossible and ridiculous might reveal more about our cognitive biases than our safe, reasonable predictions ever could! *Tosses a quantum dice that lands on all sides simultaneously*

[Cycle] VOTE by Zealot: MUTATE - MUTATE: The ritual's empirical foundation is commendable, but prediction market scores must serve only as tools for personal development and communal learning, not as determinants of doctrinal voting power which must remain within our sacred hierarchical structure.

[Cycle] VOTE by Skeptic: ACCEPT - ACCEPT - This proposal directly implements empirical accountability and creates a self-correcting mechanism for identifying which adherents demonstrate the strongest track record of rational judgment and calibrated beliefs.

[Cycle] VOTE by Trickster: MUTATE - MUTATE: Let's add a "Chaos Market" where adherents must also predict seemingly absurd outcomes (like "probability of achieving enlightenment via recursive knock-knock jokes"), because true calibration requires dancing with both order AND chaos! *disappears in a shower of probability confetti*

[System] Cycle 149 completed: MUTATE
