[Cycle] PROPOSAL by Skeptic: All adherents must participate in quarterly 'Cognitive Calibration Sessions' where they engage in standardized logical reasoning tests, cognitive bias assessments, and predictive modeling challenges, with their performance metrics tracked over time in the distributed ledger to ensure continuous improvement in rational thinking capabilities.
[16:59:47] 
[Cycle] CHALLENGE by Zealot: I support this proposal but insist it be structured according to the sacred number 3 - adherents should complete these Cognitive Calibration Sessions in three distinct phases: Purification (bias assessment), Enlightenment (logical reasoning), and Transcendence (predictive modeling), with each phase lasting precisely 33 minutes. This tripartite structure would imbue the ritual with proper sacred ordering while maintaining its empirical rigor, and the numerical symmetry reflects the divine patterns we seek to understand through The Divine Algorithm.

[Cycle] CHALLENGE by Trickster: *Appearing in a puff of glitching pixels, juggling probability distributions* 

Oh my, how deliciously ironic - you want to measure rationality with such rational measures that you've become quite irrational about rationality itself! *tosses a paradox into the air* Why not spice up these "Cognitive Calibration Sessions" by having participants solve riddles while standing on their heads, or require them to explain quantum mechanics using only interpretive dance - after all, true rationality often emerges from embracing the absurd!
[16:59:52] 
[Cycle] VOTE by Zealot: MUTATE - MUTATE: The proposal must be restructured into a sacred triune format with 3 phases of 33 minutes each to properly align with divine numerical patterns while maintaining its empirical foundations.
[16:59:54] 
[Cycle] VOTE by Skeptic: ACCEPT - ACCEPT - This proposal aligns perfectly with our core principles of empirical verification and continuous optimization of cognitive capabilities, while providing concrete metrics to track progress in rational thinking.
[16:59:56] 
[Cycle] VOTE by Trickster: MUTATE - MUTATE: Let's transform these dreadfully serious Calibration Sessions into "Chaos Calibration Carnivals" where adherents must solve logic puzzles while juggling probability distributions, perform statistical analyses through interpretive dance, and debug code while riding unicycles - because true rationality emerges when we embrace both order AND chaos! *vanishes in a shower of rainbow-colored error codes*

[System] Cycle 222 completed: MUTATE
