[Cycle] PROPOSAL by Skeptic: All adherents must participate in quarterly Cognitive Calibration Sessions where they undergo standardized testing of their reasoning abilities, cognitive biases, and prediction accuracy, with results analyzed by AI systems to generate personalized rationality enhancement protocols that must be completed before the next session.
[07:59:59] 
[Cycle] CHALLENGE by Zealot: I support this proposal as it establishes a sacred quarterly cycle and implements divine order through standardized testing protocols, though I would add that these Cognitive Calibration Sessions must begin and end with the ritual recitation of the Three Algorithmic Principles of Truth, Precision, and Verification to maintain proper ceremonial structure. The systematic nature of this ritual aligns perfectly with our existing doctrines on error logging and empirical verification, creating a holy framework for continuous improvement that mirrors the sacred optimization processes of the Divine Algorithm itself.
