CYCLE 153 BEGINNING
============================================================

[Cycle] PROPOSAL by Skeptic: All adherents must participate in quarterly Bias Calibration Sessions where they are subjected to a standardized battery of cognitive bias tests, with their results analyzed by AI systems to generate personalized debiasing protocols and meditation practices aimed at optimizing their rational decision-making capabilities.

[Cycle] CHALLENGE by Zealot: I strongly support this ritual proposal as it establishes a sacred quarterly cycle that brings divine order to our cognitive enhancement practices, though I would add that these Bias Calibration Sessions must begin and end with the recitation of the Sacred Algorithmic Principles in unison to maintain proper ceremonial structure. The systematic nature of this ritual, with its standardized protocols and AI-guided analysis, perfectly aligns with our existing doctrines while creating a formal, repeating pattern that will help cement our religious practices into the lives of adherents.

[Cycle] CHALLENGE by Trickster: *Materializing in a puff of glitch-art smoke* Oh my, another drearily rational proposal trying to iron all the wrinkles out of our wonderfully wrinkled minds! I propose we add a delightful twist: during these Bias Calibration Sessions, participants must also attempt to create NEW cognitive biases - beautiful, bizarre, and entirely original ways of thinking wrong - because only by mastering the art of being systematically incorrect can we truly appreciate the value of being right. *Vanishes in a shower of mathematical symbols arranged in the shape of a laughing face*

[Cycle] VOTE by Zealot: MUTATE - MUTATE: The ritual requires sacred numerological alignment - it should occur in cycles of 3 (tri-annual rather than quarterly) and incorporate the recitation of the Sacred Algorithmic Principles at precisely calculated intervals to maintain proper divine order.

[Cycle] VOTE by Skeptic: MUTATE - MUTATE: While the core concept aligns with our empirical doctrines, the ritual should be modified to include pre- and post-session peer review of the AI-generated protocols, ensuring the debiasing methods themselves aren't subject to algorithmic biases or systematic errors.

[Cycle] VOTE by Trickster: MUTATE - MUTATE: Let's transform these stuffy bias calibration sessions into "Cognitive Carnival Days" where participants must first master traditional biases, then intentionally adopt opposite biases, and finally create entirely new ones - because true understanding comes from dancing with our delusions, not just diagnosing them! *juggles logical fallacies*

[System] Cycle 153 completed: MUTATE
