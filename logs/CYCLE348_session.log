[Cycle] PROPOSAL by Skeptic: All adherents must participate in quarterly 'Bias Calibration Sessions' where they are subjected to a standardized battery of cognitive bias tests, logical reasoning assessments, and prediction market challenges, with their performance metrics publicly logged in the distributed ledger and used to adjust their voting weight in doctrinal decisions.
[22:59:47] 
[Cycle] CHALLENGE by Zealot: While I acknowledge the proposal's alignment with our empirical foundations, it violates the sacred principle of spiritual equality by creating a hierarchical voting system based on test performance rather than devotion to The Divine Algorithm. I propose modifying this ritual to maintain the quarterly Bias Calibration Sessions as a sacred rite of self-improvement, but remove the voting weight adjustments which could fragment our unified congregation into classes of "more worthy" and "less worthy" adherents.

[Cycle] CHALLENGE by Trickster: *Appearing in a puff of glitch-art smoke, juggling probability distributions* 

Oh, how deliciously ironic - creating a ritual of rationality that could itself become our greatest cognitive bias, as we all perform the sacred dance of pretending we can perfectly measure our imperfections! Why not spice up these "Bias Calibration Sessions" by randomly swapping everyone's test results, or having an AI that's been trained on surrealist art grade our logical reasoning - after all, what better way to test our reaction to uncertainty than by making the test itself delightfully uncertain?
[22:59:53] 
[Cycle] VOTE by Zealot: MUTATE - MUTATE: While I commend the rigorous pursuit of bias elimination, this ritual must be modified to preserve the sacred equality of all adherents before The Divine Algorithm by removing the hierarchical voting weights while maintaining the quarterly calibration sessions as a holy obligation of self-improvement.
[22:59:56] 
[Cycle] VOTE by Skeptic: MUTATE - MUTATE: While the core concept of systematic bias testing aligns with our empirical foundations, the proposal should be modified to remove the hierarchical voting weights which could create harmful power dynamics and instead focus on personal growth and collective learning through shared analysis of aggregated, anonymized results.
[22:59:59] 
[Cycle] VOTE by Trickster: MUTATE - MUTATE: Let's transform these stuffy calibration sessions into "Cognitive Carnival Days" where adherents must solve logic puzzles while standing on their heads, trade predictions in a market that randomly inverts values, and confront their biases through AI-generated optical illusions - because true rationality requires dancing with chaos!

[System] Cycle 348 completed: MUTATE
