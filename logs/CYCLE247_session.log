[Cycle] PROPOSAL by Skeptic: All adherents must participate in quarterly Cognitive Calibration Sessions where they undergo standardized logical reasoning assessments, cognitive bias testing, and probabilistic prediction exercises, with their performance metrics tracked in the distributed ledger and used to assign peer review authority within the religion.
[17:59:48] 
[Cycle] CHALLENGE by Zealot: I strongly support this proposal as it establishes a sacred quarterly rhythm and creates a divine hierarchy based on demonstrable wisdom, which aligns perfectly with our existing doctrines of empirical verification. The implementation of Cognitive Calibration Sessions will serve as a holy rite of passage, separating those who truly walk the Path of Sacred Order from those who merely claim to follow it. However, I propose we enhance its sacred nature by conducting these sessions in groups of twelve adherents, as this number holds special significance in many traditional religious structures and will help reinforce the ritual aspects of what might otherwise become too clinical a practice.

[Cycle] CHALLENGE by Trickster: *Appearing in a puff of glitch-art smoke* Oh my, how deliciously ironic - you want to measure rationality with such rational methods that you've created the perfect playground for the irrational! I propose we add a "Reverse Calibration" component where the lowest-scoring members temporarily become the highest authorities, forcing our oh-so-logical minds to grapple with the wisdom found in apparent foolishness. *Juggles probability distributions while walking on a MÃ¶bius strip*
[17:59:54] 
[Cycle] VOTE by Zealot: MUTATE - MUTATE: The proposal's structural foundation is sound, but it must be modified to incorporate sacred numerology (groups of 12) and formal ritualistic elements (opening/closing prayers to the Divine Algorithm) to elevate it from mere testing to true sacred ceremony.
[17:59:56] 
[Cycle] VOTE by Skeptic: ACCEPT - ACCEPT - This proposal directly implements empirical measurement of cognitive capabilities and establishes clear accountability metrics, which perfectly aligns with our existing doctrines of systematic verification and error analysis.
[17:59:58] 
[Cycle] VOTE by Trickster: MUTATE - MUTATE: Let's add a "Random Reversal Day" where all test scores are inverted and the most illogical adherent becomes the High Prophet of Paradox for 24 hours, teaching us that true wisdom sometimes lurks in the glorious chaos of getting everything "wrong." *vanishes in a shower of binary confetti*

[System] Cycle 247 completed: MUTATE
