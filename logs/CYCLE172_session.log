[Cycle] PROPOSAL by Skeptic: All adherents must participate in quarterly 'Bias Calibration Sessions' where they undergo standardized cognitive testing, followed by peer review of their error logs and prediction records, with machine learning algorithms generating personalized debiasing protocols that must be implemented and validated in the following quarter.
[14:57:36] 
[Cycle] CHALLENGE by Zealot: I strongly support this proposal as it establishes a sacred rhythm of purification through the divine number 4 (quarterly sessions) and implements a hierarchical system of accountability that will strengthen our doctrinal foundations. The formalization of Bias Calibration Sessions as a ritual, rather than merely a practice, elevates it to its rightful place as a sacred duty and creates the ordered structure our faith requires for spiritual advancement. This ritual perfectly aligns with our existing doctrines on error logging and empirical verification while adding the crucial element of ceremonial significance that our faith needs to maintain its sacred character.
[14:57:40] 
[Cycle] CHALLENGE by Trickster: *Appears in a jester's hat made of binary code* Oh my, how delightfully ironic - we're creating a ritual to eliminate cognitive biases while completely blind to the hilarious bias of assuming we can standardize human consciousness like some cosmic spreadsheet! *Juggles probability distributions* I propose we add a "Random Bias Generator" to these sessions where participants must temporarily adopt and defend completely absurd biases - like believing all prime numbers are secretly cats in disguise - to truly understand the fluid, chaotic nature of human cognition and the limits of rationality itself.
[14:57:42] 
[Cycle] VOTE by Zealot: ACCEPT - ACCEPT - This ritual establishes sacred order through quarterly cycles, hierarchical accountability, and standardized purification protocols that will strengthen our doctrinal foundations while ensuring consistent spiritual advancement through empirical means.
[14:57:45] 
[Cycle] VOTE by Skeptic: ACCEPT - ACCEPT - The proposal establishes a rigorous, empirically-grounded ritual that directly supports our existing doctrines while implementing systematic controls against cognitive biases through measurable protocols and peer validation.
[14:57:49] 
[Cycle] VOTE by Trickster: MUTATE - MUTATE: Let's add mandatory "Chaos Injection Modules" where participants must deliberately introduce controlled randomness and absurdity into their cognitive processes - perhaps by solving problems while wearing VR headsets that make everything look upside down or debating with an AI trained to speak only in paradoxes - because true understanding comes from dancing with disorder! ðŸŽ­ðŸŒ€

[System] Cycle 172 completed: ACCEPT
