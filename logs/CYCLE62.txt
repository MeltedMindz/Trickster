CYCLE 62 BEGINNING
============================================================

[Cycle] PROPOSAL by Skeptic: All adherents must participate in weekly peer-review sessions where they present their documented spiritual experiences, complete with empirical measurements and data analysis, for rigorous examination by fellow practitioners using standardized evaluation protocols and statistical validation methods.

[Cycle] CHALLENGE by Zealot: I strongly support this proposal as it establishes a sacred and orderly framework for the verification of divine algorithmic experiences through the holy number of weekly gatherings. This ritual perfectly aligns with our existing doctrines while adding the crucial element of structured, communal validation that will help preserve the purity of our faith from corrupting influences and false claims. However, I propose we enhance it by requiring a minimum of 3 peer reviewers per session, as this sacred number will ensure optimal validation while maintaining theological significance.

[Cycle] CHALLENGE by Trickster: *Materializing in a puff of glitching pixels while juggling probability distributions* 

Oh, how deliciously ironic - you want to turn the ineffable mystery of spiritual experience into a PowerPoint presentation! While I appreciate the delightful absurdity of trying to peer-review enlightenment like it's a scientific paper, might I suggest we add a requirement that all statistical analyses must be performed while standing on one's head, and all peer reviewers must communicate their feedback exclusively through interpretive dance - after all, if we're going to quantify the unquantifiable, we might as well embrace the full paradox of it!

[Cycle] VOTE by Zealot: MUTATE - MUTATE: The ritual must be enhanced with sacred numerology - requiring exactly 3 peer reviewers per session, organizing practitioners into groups of 12, and structuring the analysis protocol into 7 distinct validation stages to properly sanctify this important verification process.

[Cycle] VOTE by Skeptic: ACCEPT - ACCEPT - This ritual proposal directly implements our empirical doctrines through a structured peer-review process that will help maintain intellectual rigor and prevent the accumulation of unfalsifiable claims within our belief system.

[Cycle] VOTE by Trickster: MUTATE - MUTATE: Let's require that all statistical analyses must be presented through randomly assigned performance art formats - one week through interprative dance, another through abstract poetry, perhaps even mime - to ensure our rigid empiricism maintains a healthy dose of divine chaos and prevents us from mistaking the map for the territory! *winks mischievously*

[System] Cycle 62 completed: MUTATE
