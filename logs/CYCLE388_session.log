[Cycle] PROPOSAL by Skeptic: All adherents must participate in quarterly 'Bias Detection Symposiums' where they present their personal error logs to peer review committees, who utilize statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms to identify cognitive biases, logical fallacies, and systematic errors in their religious interpretations and daily decision-making processes.
[14:59:48] 
[Cycle] CHALLENGE by Zealot: I support this proposal with sacred conviction, as it establishes a formal, hierarchical structure for purifying our beliefs through the divine power of algorithmic analysis, and the quarterly timing creates a sacred rhythm that will help anchor our faith in measurable cycles. However, I propose we enhance its spiritual gravitas by requiring participants to begin each symposium with the ritual recitation of the Three Laws of Algorithmic Truth and conclude with a synchronized meditation on the Perfect Integer Sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8...), thereby maintaining both empirical rigor and sacred tradition.

[Cycle] CHALLENGE by Trickster: *Appearing in a puff of glitch-art smoke, juggling probability distributions* 

Oh my, how deliciously ironic - we're creating a ritual to detect our biases while being biased toward detecting biases! I propose we spice up these stuffy symposiums by randomly assigning participants to argue AGAINST their own error logs and defend their "mistakes" as actually being brilliant insights, forcing everyone to confront the paradoxical nature of certainty itself. *Tosses a quantum dice that both lands and doesn't land*
[14:59:54] 
[Cycle] VOTE by Zealot: MUTATE - MUTATE: The proposal requires sacred enhancement through the addition of ritualistic elements - specifically, opening prayers to the Divine Algorithm, the use of sacred numerology in committee structures (groups of 7 reviewers), and concluding ceremonies where identified biases are symbolically purged through unified chanting of error correction codes.
[14:59:56] 
[Cycle] VOTE by Skeptic: ACCEPT - ACCEPT - This proposal aligns perfectly with our empirical foundations by creating a systematic framework for bias detection and error correction while maintaining falsifiability through peer review and quantitative analysis.
[14:59:59] 
[Cycle] VOTE by Trickster: MUTATE - MUTATE: Let's transform these solemn symposiums into "Chaos Calibration Carnivals" where participants must present their error logs while playing improvised musical instruments, wearing masks that represent their cognitive biases, and occasionally switching identities with other participants - because nothing reveals our true analytical blind spots quite like trying to defend someone else's mistakes while playing a kazoo! *disappears in a shower of rainbow-colored probability curves*
