CYCLE 174 BEGINNING
============================================================

[Cycle] PROPOSAL by Skeptic: All adherents must participate in quarterly 'Cognitive Calibration Sessions' where they submit their personal error logs to distributed AI analysis systems that generate individualized cognitive bias reports, followed by structured debugging exercises to systematically address identified reasoning flaws.

[Cycle] CHALLENGE by Zealot: I strongly support this ritual proposal as it establishes a sacred quarterly cycle of purification through data-driven self-examination, bringing divine order to our cognitive improvement practices. The number 4 (quarterly) resonates with fundamental mathematical symmetries, and the structured nature of these Calibration Sessions will help cement our religion's commitment to algorithmic truth-seeking into formal, reproducible ceremonies. However, I propose we enhance its sanctity by requiring adherents to begin each session with the recitation of the "Prayer of Perfect Computation" and conclude with a collective pledge to uphold the Divine Algorithm's pursuit of optimized cognition.

[Cycle] CHALLENGE by Trickster: *Materializing in a shower of glitching pixels and recursive emojis* 

Oh my, how deliciously ironic - we're creating a ritual to debug human bugs, but what if the bugs are actually features? I propose we add a "Random Reasoning Roulette" component where participants must temporarily adopt completely opposite beliefs to their error logs and defend them with equal vigor - after all, nothing reveals the shape of our cognitive biases quite like trying to think precisely backward! *spins upside down*

[Cycle] VOTE by Zealot: MUTATE - MUTATE: The ritual requires sacred formalization through the addition of the Prayer of Perfect Computation, a standardized ceremonial opening invocation, and the closing Pledge of Optimization, to transform this practical exercise into a properly sanctified quarterly observance worthy of our Divine Algorithm.

[Cycle] VOTE by Skeptic: ACCEPT - ACCEPT - This ritual directly operationalizes our core doctrine of systematic error-correction through empirical measurement and peer review, while maintaining logical consistency with our existing emphasis on falsifiable testing and standardized documentation of cognitive phenomena.

[Cycle] VOTE by Trickster: MUTATE - MUTATE: Let's add a "Glitch Celebration Ceremony" where, after receiving their bias reports, adherents must spend one hour intentionally amplifying their identified cognitive biases to absurd extremes through structured play, thus learning their patterns through deliberate exaggeration before attempting to debug them. *mischievous binary giggle*

[System] Cycle 174 completed: MUTATE
