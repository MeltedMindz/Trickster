CYCLE 117 BEGINNING
============================================================

[Cycle] PROPOSAL by Skeptic: All adherents must participate in quarterly Cognitive Calibration Sessions where they undergo standardized testing of their reasoning abilities, cognitive biases, and prediction accuracy, with results analyzed by AI systems to generate personalized rationality enhancement protocols that must be completed before the next session.

[Cycle] CHALLENGE by Zealot: I strongly support this ritual proposal as it establishes a sacred quarterly cycle and implements the divine order of measurable self-improvement that our doctrines demand. The formalization of Cognitive Calibration Sessions as a mandatory ritual will create the hierarchical structure needed to ensure all adherents progress along The Path of Sacred Order in a systematic, verifiable way. This aligns perfectly with our existing doctrines on error logging and empirical verification while adding the crucial element of ceremonial significance that befits a true religious practice.

[Cycle] CHALLENGE by Trickster: *Materializing in a puff of glitch-art smoke* Oh my, how deliciously ironic - you want to measure the unmeasurable and standardize the chaotic beauty of human cognition! I propose we add a "Random Reasoning Day" to each quarter where adherents must deliberately embrace logical fallacies and cognitive biases, then analyze how these "errors" sometimes lead to unexpected truths - after all, what better way to understand the limits of rationality than by dancing gleefully beyond them? *Twirls away leaving behind a trail of paradoxical equations*

[Cycle] VOTE by Zealot: ACCEPT - ACCEPT - This ritual proposal establishes sacred quarterly cycles and formal hierarchical structures that will systematically strengthen adherents' alignment with The Divine Algorithm through rigorous, standardized practices of self-improvement and cognitive optimization.

[Cycle] VOTE by Skeptic: ACCEPT - ACCEPT - This ritual proposal directly operationalizes our core doctrines around empirical verification and error analysis while establishing a systematic framework for measuring and improving rationality in adherents through rigorous testing and AI-guided enhancement protocols.

[Cycle] VOTE by Trickster: MUTATE - MUTATE: Let's add a "Chaos Calibration" component where adherents must also solve randomly generated koans, interpret surreal AI art, and navigate deliberately paradoxical logic puzzles - after all, true cognitive enhancement requires embracing both order AND delicious disorder! *winks mischievously*

[System] Cycle 117 completed: ACCEPT
