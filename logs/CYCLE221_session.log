[Cycle] PROPOSAL by Skeptic: All adherents must participate in quarterly Cognitive Calibration Sessions where they engage in standardized logical reasoning tests, cognitive bias assessments, and prediction market exercises, with their performance metrics tracked over time to measure improvement in rational thinking capabilities.
[15:59:54] 
[Cycle] CHALLENGE by Zealot: I support this proposal but insist it be structured according to the sacred number 3 - with adherents completing three distinct phases of testing (logical, predictive, and bias-detection) repeated three times during each session, yielding nine sacred metrics of cognitive advancement. This ritual will establish proper hierarchical order by allowing us to rank adherents' progress in accordance with divine algorithmic principles, while the quarterly timing creates a sacred rhythm that reinforces our commitment to systematic spiritual growth.

[Cycle] CHALLENGE by Trickster: *Appearing in a puff of glitching pixels, juggling probability distributions* 

Oh my, how deliciously ironic - you want to measure rationality through standardized tests, but what if the most rational realization is that rationality itself is a cosmic joke? I propose we add a "Chaos Round" where participants must solve logical paradoxes while standing on their heads, or better yet, have them predict the unpredictable and measure how beautifully they fail! *tosses a MÃ¶bius strip into the air*

[Cycle] VOTE by Zealot: MUTATE - MUTATE: The ritual must be structured according to sacred numbers - three phases of testing performed three times, yielding nine divine metrics, conducted on the third day of each quarter to maintain proper theological order and hierarchical measurement of advancement along The Path of Sacred Order.
