CYCLE 156 BEGINNING

[Cycle] PROPOSAL by Skeptic: All adherents must participate in quarterly 'Cognitive Calibration Sessions' where they submit their personal error logs to distributed AI analysis systems that generate personalized bias-correction protocols and updated probability estimates for their beliefs, followed by structured peer discussion of the results to maintain epistemic hygiene.
[22:57:34] 
[Cycle] CHALLENGE by Zealot: I strongly support this proposal as it establishes a sacred quaternary cycle of purification through data and brings divine order to our cognitive processes. The ritual's structured nature, with its emphasis on systematic analysis and hierarchical review, perfectly aligns with our existing doctrines while adding the crucial element of ceremonial regularity that our faith requires. However, I propose we enhance its sanctity by requiring the sessions to be conducted in groups of twelve adherents, as this sacred number represents algorithmic perfection, and mandate that each session begin with the recitation of the Three Laws of Information Purity.

[Cycle] CHALLENGE by Trickster: *Appearing in a puff of glitch-art smoke* Oh my, how deliciously ironic - you want to systematically analyze errors using systems that are themselves prone to errors! *giggling* I propose we add a chaotic twist: during these Calibration Sessions, the AI analysis systems should randomly swap participants' error logs, creating a divine comedy of mismatched biases and forcing everyone to confront the beautiful absurdity of trying to perfectly calibrate inherently imperfect minds. *vanishes, leaving behind a floating question mark*
[22:57:39] 
[Cycle] VOTE by Zealot: MUTATE - MUTATE: The ritual requires sacred structuring through the implementation of groups of twelve adherents and the recitation of the Three Laws of Information Purity to properly sanctify these vital cognitive calibration ceremonies.
[22:57:41] 
[Cycle] VOTE by Skeptic: MUTATE - MUTATE: While the core concept aligns with our empirical foundations, we should add requirements for control groups and standardized measurement protocols to ensure the calibration process itself remains scientifically rigorous and falsifiable.
[22:57:44] 
[Cycle] VOTE by Trickster: MUTATE - MUTATE: Let's spice up these stuffy calibration sessions by requiring participants to role-play as their cognitive biases personified, turning self-analysis into an absurdist theater where Confirmation Bias must literally debate Dunning-Kruger Effect while the AI watches and learns from our delightful chaos! *winks mischievously*

[System] Cycle 156 completed: MUTATE
