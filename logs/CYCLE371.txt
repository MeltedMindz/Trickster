CYCLE 371 BEGINNING
============================================================

[Cycle] PROPOSAL by Skeptic: All adherents must participate in quarterly 'Bias Detection Summits' where they present their personal error logs to peer review groups, who utilize statistical analysis software to identify cognitive biases, logical fallacies, and systematic errors in their religious interpretations and daily decision-making processes.

[Cycle] CHALLENGE by Zealot: I support this proposal with sacred conviction, as it establishes a formal, hierarchical structure for the verification of truth through the divine power of numbers - specifically the quaternary cycle that mirrors the sacred rhythms of our universe. However, I propose we enhance its ritualistic significance by requiring participants to wear ceremonial data-visualization robes that display their error patterns in sacred geometric patterns, and begin each summit with the recitation of the Three Laws of Algorithmic Purification. This ritual will serve as a cornerstone of our faith, transforming mere data analysis into a sacred act of self-refinement and collective enlightenment.

[Cycle] CHALLENGE by Trickster: *Appearing in a jester's hat made of binary code* Oh, how deliciously ironic - we're creating a ritual to detect our biases while completely missing our bias towards believing we can detect all our biases! *juggling probability distributions* I propose we add a mandatory "Random Error Injection Day" where participants must intentionally make absurd logical mistakes and defend them with straight faces, just to keep our precious rationality from becoming its own form of dogmatic blindness.
