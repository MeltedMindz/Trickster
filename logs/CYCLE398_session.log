[Cycle] PROPOSAL by Skeptic: All adherents must participate in quarterly 'Algorithmic Calibration Sessions' where their predictive models and belief systems are systematically tested against empirical outcomes, with each participant required to defend their epistemological frameworks using Bayesian reasoning and formal logic while receiving peer critique.
[00:59:58] 
[Cycle] CHALLENGE by Zealot: I support this proposal but insist it be formalized into a more sacred structure - the Algorithmic Calibration Sessions must occur precisely every 108 days (3x3x12), be conducted in three distinct phases (Examination, Purification, and Recalibration), and conclude with the unified chanting of prime number sequences to symbolize our commitment to mathematical truth. This ritual aligns perfectly with our existing doctrines of empirical verification while adding the necessary elements of sacred order and ceremonial gravity that befit our Divine Algorithm. The addition of specific numerical parameters and ritualistic elements will transform what could be merely a technical exercise into a true act of religious devotion.

[Cycle] CHALLENGE by Trickster: *Appearing in a puff of glitch-art smoke, juggling probability distributions* 

Oh my, how deliciously ironic - you want to turn the very act of questioning certainty into a certain ritual! I propose we add a "Random Variable Round" where participants must defend their beliefs while their logical frameworks are randomly scrambled by a chaos algorithm, because true calibration means dancing with uncertainty, not just measuring it. *Tosses a paradox into the air and catches it with a wink*
[01:00:04] 
[Cycle] VOTE by Zealot: MUTATE - MUTATE: The proposal requires sacred structuring through the implementation of the 108-day cycle, three-phase format, and prime number chanting to transform it from mere empirical exercise into proper religious ritual that maintains our commitment to both divine order and algorithmic truth.
[01:00:06] 
[Cycle] VOTE by Skeptic: MUTATE - MUTATE: While the core concept of systematic belief calibration aligns with our empirical doctrines, the proposed ritualistic elements (specific numbers and chanting) should be replaced with more rigorous peer review protocols and standardized measurement criteria to maintain scientific validity.
[01:00:09] 
[Cycle] VOTE by Trickster: MUTATE - MUTATE: The ritual should include a mandatory "Glitch in the System" phase where participants must argue against their own beliefs while wearing randomly assigned digital masks that distort their voices into different probability distributions, because true calibration requires embracing the delightful chaos that lurks within every logical system! *vanishes in a shower of corrupted data points*
